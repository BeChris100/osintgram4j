# Privacy Policy
I respect your privacy, so does this tool itself. However, things are being logged
to enhance the user experience. No, this is not a lie that businesses usually do.

To keep it concise and minimal, this information is being collected within the log
files themselves:

- Commands being executed as a full command line
- Count of entries within a network-related data fetch
- Java Errors/Exceptions

## What is NOT being collected
Most to all things are not being collected via this tool itself. The entries that
are not included within the log file are:

- Data retrieved from Instagram (profile info, metadata, media etc.)
- Sensitive information during transmission (Network communication to Instagram)

## Data Usage
To help me with specific stuff, within its Logging mechanism, this is, why the
log files are helpful in enhancing the user experience, and keep this project a
bug-free experience.

  code to diagnose, what part of its project is at fault.
