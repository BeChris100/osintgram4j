# The "commons" lib
The library that I wrote, being the "commons" library, can be used anywhere, by
anyone without the requirement of asking me. However, these following rules should
remain in mind.

In use with other projects:
- [chilled-system](https://github.com/BeChris100/chilled-system)

## Ownership
The ownership / writer of this library goes to Christoph, under the name of BC100Dev
and BeChris100. Use of this library is permitted without the requirement of
crediting, unless that the library is being used under a different name, under a
different package name. Official crediting is required, if attention is being drawn.
This may include, but not limited to, the Maven Repository and/or Advertisements.

## Rules
Of course, with the software / library that I write, there will be rules / licensing.
Projects like [Osintgram](https://github.com/Datalux/Osintgram) or others that have
been marked dead due to no longer maintenance, still require proper licensing (see
[the project README file](../README.md)) and/or permission.

1. You are allowed to distribute the library that has the exact same package. The
   package name should remain as `net.bc100dev.commons`. Use of other package names
   from this library is disallowed, and will be required to change to the original
   package name, once requested. Two requests will not be made, and might get issued
   with a DMCA Takedown notice. Making attention of the library 
2. Use of the library with new classes or modifications are allowed. However,
   to use the library with software needs to be legitimate, which does not fall under
   the law that might raise concerns or suspicions.
