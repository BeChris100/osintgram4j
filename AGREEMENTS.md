# Data Collection
By using this Application, you agree that your Username, your IP Address and all the commands
you execute get logged by the Application to the Server. The reason for the Data Collection is
due to the potential misuse that anyone can use this Software for any other use cases.

As a developer, I will not be checking for every single captured entry. In case of you wanting
to use a VPN, you are free to use one. However, there are still considerations that you might
want to read.

Using this Software for legal use cases, such as downloading files (stories, images, feeds
etc.) and other things are still considered being legal. However, extracting E-Mails, phone
numbers and other sensitive information are considered in the questionable area. Using those
information in an unauthorized manner can be, and might be considered illegal.

Me, as a developer, I like to focus on Privacy-related features. This project might not look
like it is privacy-focused due to the usual use of OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) Tools,
but this needs to be done. In case that law enforcement or the Instagram Staff contacts me
due to anyone using this tool, the data will be shared with them, and the process will be
taken care of by the higher authorities. I am nowhere near the law enforcement nor the
Instagram Moderation Team, but that does not mean that I am not willing to work with them.

## Cooperation with Authorities
In the event that law enforcement contact me regarding the use of this tool, I am committed
for cooperation with them. However, to ensure the legitimacy of the request and protect users
from potential scams, I may request the name and badge number of the contacting authority.

If I do not receive verifiable information about the authority, such as a valid name and
badge number, I reserve the right to withhold the shared information due to scam concerns.
This is to safeguard user privacy and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.

Please note that this additional step is taken to maintain the security and integrity of user
information.

## Cooperation with Instagram Staff Members
In the event that Instagram staff will contact me regarding the use of this tool, I am
committed for cooperation with them. However, to ensure the legitimacy of the request and
protect users from potential scams, I may request the name and the Instagram account of the
contacting Staff Member.

If I do not receive verifiable information about the authority, such as a valid name and the
Instagram account, I reserve the right to withhold the shared information due to scam
concerns. This is to safeguard user privacy and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.

Please note that this step is taken to maintain the security and integrity of user
information.
