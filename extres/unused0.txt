2024 and 2025.
The year of Linux.
Or, that's what they always say.
I would rather say, "the decade of Linux".
Linux won't be as popular as people think.
People will still use Windows and macOS, even if it means, getting spied by big companies, like Microsoft.

However, the other topics are still on the rise.
Ever heard about Malware? Maybe even Scams, or the "rise of AI"?
If so, then you should stop believing in those lies.
They will lie to you.
Not even the Linux operating systems can save you. Android is Linux-based, if you didn't know.

Oh, and scams... oh boy, you fell into a dark trap.
While they are still on the rise, maybe you should consider protecting yourself.
More likely, get some awareness on how they work, watch YouTubers doing their Scam-baits...
Or even maybe, you should join them. Start consider using Linux.
It will be worth it.

What about AI, you may ask?
Well... it isn't dangerous. It won't take over the world, as you may believe in Elon.
He is lying to you.
While yes, AI can be dangerous, but it's not dangerous as people might be scared of.
Don't be an Elon fan.
Be a fan of people that are trustworthy. I may suggest watching SomeOrdinaryGamers.
He is pretty much entertaining.

You may also ask about Malware.
They won't stop, especially concerns with Ransomware.
There are the White-Hat hackers that are on your side...
but there are also Black-Hat hackers that are not on your side.
Hackers that are against you. Hackers that want total control over your devices.
They want to steal your data, and sell them off on the dark web.
Also, you may wonder, why dare I invoke Ransomware? What about Trojans, Spyware and others?
Those are concerns, but Ransomware is mainly the way to gather money from innocent or guilty people.
Linux might also be a thing that you could protect yourself because not everything runs under Linux.
But with Wine being improved from time to time, Malware will no longer work on Windows only.
It will soon come to Linux.

Be prepared.
