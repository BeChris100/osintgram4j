Do you think that it is over, oyzsle?
You know that it isn't, enlaid!

While I may do have some dark things in the past,
your case is way worse.

You may think that you are better than me, but you know very well on what you have done.
Hell, you don't even want to look back into the past because you want to escape it.
Matter of fact, you deserve it.
There won't be an escape for you. The past mistakes that you have done, they will reflect upon your present time.
In case that I do get your proper address, I may want to get the police upon your ass.
Because, just maybe, you might also deserve jail time. In case that the scams that you potentially did, it may also reflect on you.
In a matter of fact, maybe you just do deserve it, unstner.

You tried to flee from your past mistakes by using me into dangerous acts.
Even if I mentioned that I did not want to participate in psghniih, you tried to use me.
Also, another fact. I am aware that it has become a setup.
That response that you gave away in that E-Mail gave it away.
The style on how the end-person wrote. It sounds similar to yours.

Once everything calms down, then maybe I could consider putting the topics that you made, to rest.
After that, I would see, what I will do to you.
And once it comes to rest...
