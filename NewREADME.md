# Osintgram4j: OSINT for Instagram
Remember, how the beloved Osintgram project by [Datalux](https://github.com/Datalux)
fell apart due to Instagram's API changes and lack of updates? Well, you can stop
worrying. Osintgram4j aims to fix the issues, and make [the original
Project](https://github.com/Datalux/Osintgram) look like it was never broken. It's
a complete rewrite in Java, bringing back stability, along with new features.

***Note***: This project is still under development, with the original code being
analyzed, along with researches being made. Full functionality is not guaranteed
at this stage.

## Potential Takedown
The original developer has every right to request the project to be taken down. Since
I originally was contacting the developer, I am proceeding cautiously to avoid
Takedown notices, while strictly following licensing guidelines.

Understandably, I don't want to see this project being shut down. If forced, you'll
know the reason, why.

## Reasoning on Development
The motivation for starting this project is to bring back stability back to the
Osintgram project. The updates of the Instagram API was constantly breaking the
project apart, and me, as a community-based person, I wasn't letting it slide,
without someone stepping in, and finally fixing it. I've also switched to Java for
the advantages that it also has, which one of them include Performance. Compiled
Java code is faster than interpreted Python code.

## Build Process
This project is mainly focused and optimized for **the Linux platform**. Simple
setup with the Shell scripts:

1. **_Clone the repo_**: `git clone https://github.com/BeChris100/osintgram4j`
2. **_Set permissions_**: `chmod +x setup.sh build.sh`
3. **_Set up environment_**: `./setup.sh --force-download`
4. **_Build_**: `./build.sh`

The `--force-download` is an optional parameter. If given, it will always download
the JDK and the libraries, no matter its state. Otherwise, it will try to detect
JDK 21, and get the latest `org.json` library.

Workaround for other platforms (Android, Windows, macOS, â€¦):
- Virtual Machines
- Cloud Shell/Servers
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
- Linux Containers (e.g. Docker)

## Client Mods
Osintgram4j introduces a Modding API, which is something that I like. Having the
ability to modify the client directly instead of creating separate forks for each
modification is better than handling each fork, which could eventually make that fork
outdated from its original source. Allowing to customize and extend is functionality
is something anyone would want.

As always, prioritize privacy and security, along with downloading mods from trusted
sources.
