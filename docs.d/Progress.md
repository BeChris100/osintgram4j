## Stages
I decided to separate the different stages of progress for the project, where each
stage will go through its Tests and other things.

| Stage | Progress      |
|-------|---------------|
| 1     | In work       |
| 2     | In work       |
| 3     | Work Not Made |
| 4     | Work Not Made |
| 5     | Work Not Made |

### Stage 1: Core
The very first insights of the project forming. It consists of the Core Parts, which
include the interactive Shell that can interact with several parts of the project,
such as the Settings, Resources, Enhancements, Runtime and Management.

### Stage 2: API & Networking
The main part on what the project will mainly use: The Network parts. It is there to
communicate with the Instagram servers, so that you can get the magic in front of
you. The magic is somewhat rather of Authentication, Interaction and Downloads. As
of my knowledge on what the official Osintgram does, there is no such thing as
uploading data, and will only be able to download data. I mean, that's the concept of
OSINT: to gather information.

### Stage 3: The defaults
The concept of the original Osintgram will be happening here. Basically, this stage
will contain all the concepts of what it is intended to do, such as reading
information (Target Followers, Target Followings etc.), downloads (Stories, Photos,
Videos) and others.

### Stage 4: Initial Tests
After the project will be finished, I will be taking care of some testing, which
I'll pretty much try to get some people into giving out something, if they wish to.
Now, I won't force anything, but I do want the project into being functional.

### Stage 5: Beta Testing
When the initial tests will be finished, I will take care into sharing the beta
version of Osintgram4j to some users, which means that once everything works as
expected, the Release of Osintgram4j will be released on GitHub, and to the public.
